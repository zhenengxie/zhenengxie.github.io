# General tips on submitting work

If you do not have access to a scanner, please consider using a phone app to properly crop your work. Please use the flash in order to prevent your phone casting a shadow. Personally I have used and can recommend Notebloc on Android. For iOS the Notes app has this feature, but I have not personally tried it.

Please try not to hand in work last minute. This is already inadvisable with hard copies of your work, and is an even worse idea with digital submissions seen as you will need time to properly scan your work and time to upload your work.
