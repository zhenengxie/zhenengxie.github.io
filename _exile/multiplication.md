In this post we go through how to multiply numbers.

There's a few basic prequisites though. You'll need to already know addition of numbers and multiplication of single digit numbers. Oh, and discrete Fourier transforms.

For simplicity we'll assume the two numbers being mutliplied are both the same length, say length $$n$$.
