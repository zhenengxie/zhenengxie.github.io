# Information

In this reading group we will be following the second edition of ["Lévy Processes and Stochastic Calculus"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/levy-processes-and-stochastic-calculus/4AC698D37D3D8E57D099B73ADF4ACB11) by David Applebaum. We plan to start with Section 1.2 and work to the end of the first chapter in Hilary term.

The [schedule](#schedule) lists the material that participants are suggested to read before each session. Members of the reading group are encouraged to participate in presenting the material or solutions to exercises.

# Prequisites

A basic knowledge of measure and probability theory is needed. The material in Section 1.1 of the book serves as a good review of these topics. Familiarity with Brownian motion is helpful but not essential.

# Accessing the book

Members of Oxford Unversity can access the book online in a PDF format by following these steps:

1. Press the "Log in" button on the top right of [this page](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/levy-processes-and-stochastic-calculus/4AC698D37D3D8E57D099B73ADF4ACB11)
2. Choose "Log in via Shibboleth or Athens"
3. Select "University of Oxford" as the organization
4. Sign in using your Oxford Single Sign-On details

Below each chapter there should now be a green checkmark with "Access" written next to it. Click on PDF to access the file for each chapter.

Next term we plan on continuing this reading group looking at a exploring the further topics that we'll briefly read about in the last session, such as the Lévy-Itô decomposition, recurrence and transience and local times. More details will be given before next term.
