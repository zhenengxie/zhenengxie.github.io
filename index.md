Hi and welcome to my site! To introduce myself, I'm a PhD student (technically a DPhil student) in the Random Systems CDT, based in the Oxford University Statistics Department, and supervised by Prof. Christina Goldschmidt. I'm also a member of St. Hugh's College.

This website is intended as a central hub for my research, teaching and outreach activities.
