The model that got me interested in my current area of research is the Erdős--Renyi model and the emergence of the giant component, so a visualisation of it seemed suitable for a logo.

# The emergence of the giant component

The Erdős--Renyi graph $$G(n, p)$$ is one of the simplest random graphs that can be studied. It has two parameters, $$n$$ the number of vertices and $$p \in [0, 1]$$ a probability. To samples $$G(n, p)$$ we take a $$n$$ vertices and draw an edge between pair of vertices with probability $$p$$ independently of the other edges.

The appearance of the giant cluster refers to a phase transition in the size of the largest connected component of the graph. Introduce a new parameter $$\alpha$$ and let $$p_n = \frac{\alpha}{n}$$. List the connected components of $$G(n, p_n)$$ in decreasing order of size as $$C^n_1, C^n_2, \ldots$$ where we pad the list by empty graphs once we run out of component. Erdős and Renyi proved the following:

- If $$\alpha < 1$$ then $$\abs{C^n_i} = \Theta_p(\log n)$$ for all $$i \geq 1$$.
- If $$\alpha > 1$$ then $$\abs{C^n_i} = \Theta_p(\log n)$$ for all $$i \geq 2$$ and $$\abs{C^n_1} = \Theta_p(n)$$.

Putting this into words, when $$\alpha < 1$$ all the components are small compared to $$n$$, specifically of order $$\log n$$. On the other hand when $$\alpha > 1$$ all the components other than the largest are still of order $$\log n$$ whereas the size of the largest component is of order $$n$$. Hence the largest component becomes far bigger than the other components. This is what is meant by the emergence of the giant component.

# Drawing it

We want to see this transition happen in a circular form. The $$n$$ vertices of $$G(n, p)$$ can be represented as $$n$$ equally sized arc lengths of a circle. We then only keep the arc lengths corresponding to the vertices in the largest component. So a specific sample would look something like this.

The black vertices are in the graph on the left are the vertices in the largest component. These vertices are represented by the arcs on the right.

To combine different value of $$p$$, we vary $$\alpha$$ from 0 to 2 and then take $$p = \alpha / n$$. Then we do the procedue described above with a circle of radius $$\alpha$$. For each $$\alpha$$ we use an indepedent sample of $$G(n, p)$$, the same value of $$n$$ and the same thickness of the arc. Then playing around the the number of steps we take for $$\alpha$$, the number of vertices $$n$$ we use, we end up with the below image and the line width we end up with the below image.

The phase transition actually turned out more visible than I expected. Even though $$p$$ is proportional to the radius, you can see a sharp-ish transition in how much of the circle is filled. This transition is further exaggerated once we shrink it down to logo size; the subcritical regime looks blank whereas the supercritical regime looks grey.
