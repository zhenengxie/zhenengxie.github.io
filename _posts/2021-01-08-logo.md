The model that got me interested in my current area of research is the Erdős--Renyi model and the emergence of the giant component, so a visualisation of it seemed suitable for a logo.

# The emergence of the giant component

The Erdős--Rényi graph $$G(n, p)$$ is one of the simplest random graphs that can be studied. It has two parameters, $$n$$ the number of vertices and $$p \in [0, 1]$$ a probability. To samples $$G(n, p)$$ we start with $$n$$ vertices. Independently for every pair of vertices, we draw an edge between the two vertices with probability $$p$$. This is also known as percolation on the complete graph.

The appearance of the giant cluster refers to a phase transition in the size of the largest connected component of the graph. Introduce a new parameter $$\alpha$$ and let $$p_n = \frac{\alpha}{n}$$. List the connected components of $$G(n, p_n)$$ in decreasing order of size as $$C^n_1, C^n_2, \ldots$$ with empty graphs once we run out of components. Erdős and Rényi proved the following:

- If $$\alpha < 1$$ then $$\abs{C^n_i} = \Theta_p(\log n)$$ for all $$i \geq 1$$.
- If $$\alpha > 1$$ then $$\abs{C^n_i} = \Theta_p(\log n)$$ for all $$i \geq 2$$ and $$\abs{C^n_1} = \Theta_p(n)$$.

Putting this into words, when $$\alpha < 1$$ all the components are small compared to $$n$$, specifically of order $$\log n$$. On the other hand when $$\alpha > 1$$ all the components other than the largest are still of order $$\log n$$ whereas the size of the largest component is of order $$n$$. Hence the largest component becomes far bigger than the other components. This is what is meant by the emergence of the giant component.

# Drawing it

We want to see this transition happen in a circular form. The $$n$$ vertices of $$G(n, p)$$ can be represented as $$n$$ equally sized arc lengths of a circle. We then only keep the arc lengths corresponding to the vertices in the largest component. So a specific sample would look something like this.

The black vertices are in the graph on the left are the vertices in the largest component. These vertices are represented by the arcs on the right.

We then take $$\alpha$$ in steps from 0 to 2, covering the transition at $$\alpha = 1$$. For each value of $$\alpha$$ take an independent sample of $$G(n, \alpha / n)$$ and carry out the procedure in the above paragraph with a circle of radius $$\alpha$$. Although $$\alpha$$ is increasing linearly from the center, we expect to see a non-linear transition in how much of the circle is filled.

I ended up using the same value of $$n$$ and the same line thickness for all $$\alpha$$. Playing with these parameters along with the number of steps for $$n$$, we finally end up with the following image.

The phase transition actually turned out more visible than I expected. The transition is further exaggerated once we shrink it down to logo size; the subcritical regime looks blank whereas the supercritical regime looks grey. All in all I think this is a pretty neat visualisation of the emergence of the giant component.
